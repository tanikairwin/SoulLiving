![Soul Living Logo](static/assets/images/soullivinglogo.png)

Many women struggle to find holistic services that are easy to book and have regular sessions that fit around their weekly schedules, meaning it's hard for them to make time for holistic practices that can benefit their health. Soul Living was created  to help provide women with an easy access booking system to book weekly meditation and yoga sessions as well as keep track of their bookings so that they can make time for their holistic practices each week. Our primary audience is women interested in meditation, yoga and other holistic practices and are looking for a space to connect with like minded women. They may lead busy lives and find it hard to fit these practices within their weekly schedules.
